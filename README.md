# WooCommerce Product Search Admin powered by Algolia

A WordPress plugin that provides ultra-fast, as-you-type product search for your WooCommerce admin, powered by Algolia.

## Description

This plugin powers the WooCommerce products search input with an autocompleted search field providing results as you type in milliseconds, regardless of how many products you have in your database.

When you have a large number of products in WooCommerce, searching for a specific product can become slow and time-consuming. This plugin solves that problem by indexing all your products into Algolia, allowing you to find products at the speed of thought right from your usual products list in the admin screen.

Key features:
* Lightning-fast product search in the admin
* Search across multiple fields (title, SKU, description, etc.)
* Typo-tolerant searching
* Automatic synchronization when products are added, updated, or deleted
* Works with variable products and attributes

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wc-product-search-admin` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin with your Algolia API keys
